<blockquote>My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br/>
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br/>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br/>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br/>
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,<br/>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br/>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br/>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br/>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br/>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br/>
I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br/>
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As any she belied with false compare.<br/>
