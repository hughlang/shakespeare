<blockquote>Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;<br/>
And that which governs me to go about<br/>
Doth part his function and is partly blind,<br/>
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;<br/>
For it no form delivers to the heart<br/>
Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:<br/>
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,<br/>
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:<br/>
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,<br/>
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,<br/>
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,<br/>
The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Incapable of more, replete with you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.<br/>
