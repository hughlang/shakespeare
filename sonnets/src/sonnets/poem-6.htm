<blockquote>Then let not winter's ragged hand deface<br/>
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:<br/>
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place<br/>
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.<br/>
That use is not forbidden usury,<br/>
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;<br/>
That's for thyself to breed another thee,<br/>
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;<br/>
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,<br/>
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:<br/>
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,<br/>
Leaving thee living in posterity?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.<br/>
