<blockquote>Those lines that I before have writ do lie,<br/>
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:<br/>
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why<br/>
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.<br/>
But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents<br/>
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,<br/>
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,<br/>
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;<br/>
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,<br/>
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'<br/>
When I was certain o'er incertainty,<br/>
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Love is a babe; then might I not say so,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To give full growth to that which still doth grow?<br/>
