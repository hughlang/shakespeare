<blockquote>Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,<br/>
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;<br/>
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,<br/>
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.<br/>
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show<br/>
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;<br/>
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know<br/>
Time's thievish progress to eternity.<br/>
Look, what thy memory can not contain<br/>
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find<br/>
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,<br/>
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.<br/>
