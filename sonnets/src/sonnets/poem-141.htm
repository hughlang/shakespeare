<blockquote>In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,<br/>
For they in thee a thousand errors note;<br/>
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,<br/>
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;<br/>
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,<br/>
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,<br/>
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited<br/>
To any sensual feast with thee alone:<br/>
But my five wits nor my five senses can<br/>
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,<br/>
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,<br/>
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Only my plague thus far I count my gain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That she that makes me sin awards me pain.<br/>
