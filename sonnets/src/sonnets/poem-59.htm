<blockquote>If there be nothing new, but that which is<br/>
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,<br/>
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss<br/>
The second burden of a former child!<br/>
O, that record could with a backward look,<br/>
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,<br/>
Show me your image in some antique book,<br/>
Since mind at first in character was done!<br/>
That I might see what the old world could say<br/>
To this composed wonder of your frame;<br/>
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,<br/>
Or whether revolution be the same.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, sure I am, the wits of former days<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To subjects worse have given admiring praise.<br/>
