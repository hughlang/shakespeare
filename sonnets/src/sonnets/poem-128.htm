<blockquote>How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,<br/>
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds<br/>
With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st<br/>
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,<br/>
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap<br/>
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,<br/>
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,<br/>
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!<br/>
To be so tickled, they would change their state<br/>
And situation with those dancing chips,<br/>
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,<br/>
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.<br/>
