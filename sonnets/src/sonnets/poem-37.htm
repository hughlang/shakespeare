<blockquote>As a decrepit father takes delight<br/>
To see his active child do deeds of youth,<br/>
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,<br/>
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.<br/>
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,<br/>
Or any of these all, or all, or more,<br/>
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,<br/>
I make my love engrafted to this store:<br/>
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,<br/>
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give<br/>
That I in thy abundance am sufficed<br/>
And by a part of all thy glory live.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This wish I have; then ten times happy me!<br/>
