<blockquote>Or I shall live your epitaph to make,<br/>
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;<br/>
From hence your memory death cannot take,<br/>
Although in me each part will be forgotten.<br/>
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,<br/>
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:<br/>
The earth can yield me but a common grave,<br/>
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.<br/>
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,<br/>
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,<br/>
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse<br/>
When all the breathers of this world are dead;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.<br/>
