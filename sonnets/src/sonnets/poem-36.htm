<blockquote>Let me confess that we two must be twain,<br/>
Although our undivided loves are one:<br/>
So shall those blots that do with me remain<br/>
Without thy help by me be borne alone.<br/>
In our two loves there is but one respect,<br/>
Though in our lives a separable spite,<br/>
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,<br/>
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.<br/>
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,<br/>
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,<br/>
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,<br/>
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not so; I love thee in such sort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br/>
