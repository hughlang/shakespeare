<blockquote>Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,<br/>
As, to behold desert a beggar born,<br/>
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,<br/>
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,<br/>
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,<br/>
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,<br/>
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,<br/>
And strength by limping sway disabled,<br/>
And art made tongue-tied by authority,<br/>
And folly doctor-like controlling skill,<br/>
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,<br/>
And captive good attending captain ill:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.<br/>
