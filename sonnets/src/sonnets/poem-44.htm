<blockquote>If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,<br/>
Injurious distance should not stop my way;<br/>
For then despite of space I would be brought,<br/>
From limits far remote where thou dost stay.<br/>
No matter then although my foot did stand<br/>
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;<br/>
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land<br/>
As soon as think the place where he would be.<br/>
But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,<br/>
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,<br/>
But that so much of earth and water wrought<br/>
I must attend time's leisure with my moan,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Receiving nought by elements so slow<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.<br/>
