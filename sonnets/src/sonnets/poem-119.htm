<blockquote>What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,<br/>
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,<br/>
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,<br/>
Still losing when I saw myself to win!<br/>
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,<br/>
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!<br/>
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted<br/>
In the distraction of this madding fever!<br/>
O benefit of ill! now I find true<br/>
That better is by evil still made better;<br/>
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,<br/>
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So I return rebuked to my content<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.<br/>
