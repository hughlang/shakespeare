<blockquote>In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,<br/>
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,<br/>
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,<br/>
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.<br/>
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,<br/>
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;<br/>
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee<br/>
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,<br/>
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,<br/>
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,<br/>
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,<br/>
Or made them swear against the thing they see;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To swear against the truth so foul a lie!<br/>
