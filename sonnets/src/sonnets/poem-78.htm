<blockquote>So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse<br/>
And found such fair assistance in my verse<br/>
As every alien pen hath got my use<br/>
And under thee their poesy disperse.<br/>
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing<br/>
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly<br/>
Have added feathers to the learned's wing<br/>
And given grace a double majesty.<br/>
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,<br/>
Whose influence is thine and born of thee:<br/>
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,<br/>
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But thou art all my art and dost advance<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As high as learning my rude ignorance.<br/>
