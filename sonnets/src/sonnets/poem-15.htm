<blockquote>When I consider every thing that grows<br/>
Holds in perfection but a little moment,<br/>
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows<br/>
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;<br/>
When I perceive that men as plants increase,<br/>
Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,<br/>
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,<br/>
And wear their brave state out of memory;<br/>
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay<br/>
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,<br/>
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,<br/>
To change your day of youth to sullied night;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all in war with Time for love of you,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As he takes from you, I engraft you new.<br/>
