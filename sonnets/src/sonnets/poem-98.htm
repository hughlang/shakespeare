<blockquote>From you have I been absent in the spring,<br/>
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim<br/>
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,<br/>
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.<br/>
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell<br/>
Of different flowers in odour and in hue<br/>
Could make me any summer's story tell,<br/>
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;<br/>
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,<br/>
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;<br/>
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,<br/>
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As with your shadow I with these did play:<br/>
