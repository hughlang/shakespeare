<blockquote>Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,<br/>
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:<br/>
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,<br/>
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;<br/>
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,<br/>
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments<br/>
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,<br/>
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.<br/>
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those<br/>
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:<br/>
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows<br/>
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By self-example mayst thou be denied!<br/>
