<blockquote>Your love and pity doth the impression fill<br/>
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;<br/>
For what care I who calls me well or ill,<br/>
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?<br/>
You are my all the world, and I must strive<br/>
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:<br/>
None else to me, nor I to none alive,<br/>
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.<br/>
In so profound abysm I throw all care<br/>
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense<br/>
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.<br/>
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You are so strongly in my purpose bred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That all the world besides methinks are dead.<br/>
