<blockquote>Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,<br/>
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?<br/>
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,<br/>
And that your love taught it this alchemy,<br/>
To make of monsters and things indigest<br/>
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,<br/>
Creating every bad a perfect best,<br/>
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?<br/>
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,<br/>
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:<br/>
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,<br/>
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.<br/>
