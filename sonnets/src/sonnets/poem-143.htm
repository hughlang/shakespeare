<blockquote>Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch<br/>
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,<br/>
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch<br/>
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,<br/>
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,<br/>
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent<br/>
To follow that which flies before her face,<br/>
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;<br/>
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,<br/>
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;<br/>
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,<br/>
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.<br/>
