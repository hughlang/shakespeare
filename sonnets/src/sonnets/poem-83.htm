<blockquote>I never saw that you did painting need<br/>
And therefore to your fair no painting set;<br/>
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed<br/>
The barren tender of a poet's debt;<br/>
And therefore have I slept in your report,<br/>
That you yourself being extant well might show<br/>
How far a modern quill doth come too short,<br/>
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.<br/>
This silence for my sin you did impute,<br/>
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;<br/>
For I impair not beauty being mute,<br/>
When others would give life and bring a tomb.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There lives more life in one of your fair eyes<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Than both your poets can in praise devise.<br/>
