<blockquote>Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,<br/>
That having such a scope to show her pride,<br/>
The argument all bare is of more worth<br/>
Than when it hath my added praise beside!<br/>
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!<br/>
Look in your glass, and there appears a face<br/>
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,<br/>
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.<br/>
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,<br/>
To mar the subject that before was well?<br/>
For to no other pass my verses tend<br/>
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And more, much more, than in my verse can sit<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Your own glass shows you when you look in it.<br/>
