<blockquote>Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;<br/>
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;<br/>
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;<br/>
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.<br/>
As on the finger of a throned queen<br/>
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,<br/>
So are those errors that in thee are seen<br/>
To truths translated and for true things deem'd.<br/>
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,<br/>
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!<br/>
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,<br/>
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But do not so; I love thee in such sort<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.<br/>
