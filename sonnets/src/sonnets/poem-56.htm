<blockquote>Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said<br/>
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,<br/>
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,<br/>
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:<br/>
So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill<br/>
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,<br/>
To-morrow see again, and do not kill<br/>
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.<br/>
Let this sad interim like the ocean be<br/>
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new<br/>
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see<br/>
Return of love, more blest may be the view;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Else call it winter, which being full of care<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.<br/>
