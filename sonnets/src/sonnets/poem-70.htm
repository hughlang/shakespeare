<blockquote>That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,<br/>
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;<br/>
The ornament of beauty is suspect,<br/>
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.<br/>
So thou be good, slander doth but approve<br/>
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;<br/>
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,<br/>
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.<br/>
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,<br/>
Either not assail'd or victor being charged;<br/>
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,<br/>
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.<br/>
