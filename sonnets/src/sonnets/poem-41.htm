<blockquote>Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,<br/>
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,<br/>
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,<br/>
For still temptation follows where thou art.<br/>
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,<br/>
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;<br/>
And when a woman woos, what woman's son<br/>
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?<br/>
Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,<br/>
And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,<br/>
Who lead thee in their riot even there<br/>
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.<br/>
