<blockquote>My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,<br/>
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,<br/>
Reserve their character with golden quill<br/>
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.<br/>
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,<br/>
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'<br/>
To every hymn that able spirit affords<br/>
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.<br/>
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'<br/>
And to the most of praise add something more;<br/>
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,<br/>
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then others for the breath of words respect,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.<br/>
