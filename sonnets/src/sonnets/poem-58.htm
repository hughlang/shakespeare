<blockquote>That god forbid that made me first your slave,<br/>
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,<br/>
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,<br/>
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!<br/>
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,<br/>
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;<br/>
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,<br/>
Without accusing you of injury.<br/>
Be where you list, your charter is so strong<br/>
That you yourself may privilege your time<br/>
To what you will; to you it doth belong<br/>
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.<br/>
