<blockquote>Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,<br/>
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,<br/>
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,<br/>
And all those friends which I thought buried.<br/>
How many a holy and obsequious tear<br/>
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye<br/>
As interest of the dead, which now appear<br/>
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!<br/>
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,<br/>
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,<br/>
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;<br/>
That due of many now is thine alone:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Their images I loved I view in thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.<br/>
