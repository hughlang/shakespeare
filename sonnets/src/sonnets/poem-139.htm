<blockquote>O, call not me to justify the wrong<br/>
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;<br/>
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;<br/>
Use power with power and slay me not by art.<br/>
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,<br/>
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:<br/>
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might<br/>
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?<br/>
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows<br/>
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,<br/>
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,<br/>
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.<br/>
