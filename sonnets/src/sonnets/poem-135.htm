<blockquote>Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'<br/>
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;<br/>
More than enough am I that vex thee still,<br/>
To thy sweet will making addition thus.<br/>
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,<br/>
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?<br/>
Shall will in others seem right gracious,<br/>
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?<br/>
The sea all water, yet receives rain still<br/>
And in abundance addeth to his store;<br/>
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'<br/>
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'<br/>
