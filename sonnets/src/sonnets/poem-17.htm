<blockquote>Who will believe my verse in time to come,<br/>
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?<br/>
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb<br/>
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.<br/>
If I could write the beauty of your eyes<br/>
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,<br/>
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:<br/>
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'<br/>
So should my papers yellow'd with their age<br/>
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,<br/>
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage<br/>
And stretched metre of an antique song:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But were some child of yours alive that time,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.<br/>
