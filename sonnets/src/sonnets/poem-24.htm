<blockquote>Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd<br/>
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;<br/>
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,<br/>
And perspective it is the painter's art.<br/>
For through the painter must you see his skill,<br/>
To find where your true image pictured lies;<br/>
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,<br/>
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.<br/>
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:<br/>
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me<br/>
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun<br/>
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They draw but what they see, know not the heart.<br/>
