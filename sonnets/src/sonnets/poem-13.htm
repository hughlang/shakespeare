<blockquote>O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are<br/>
No longer yours than you yourself here live:<br/>
Against this coming end you should prepare,<br/>
And your sweet semblance to some other give.<br/>
So should that beauty which you hold in lease<br/>
Find no determination: then you were<br/>
Yourself again after yourself's decease,<br/>
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.<br/>
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,<br/>
Which husbandry in honour might uphold<br/>
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day<br/>
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a father: let your son say so.<br/>
