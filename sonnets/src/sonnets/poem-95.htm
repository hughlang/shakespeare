<blockquote>How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame<br/>
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,<br/>
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!<br/>
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!<br/>
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,<br/>
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,<br/>
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;<br/>
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.<br/>
O, what a mansion have those vices got<br/>
Which for their habitation chose out thee,<br/>
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,<br/>
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.<br/>
