<blockquote>Let not my love be call'd idolatry,<br/>
Nor my beloved as an idol show,<br/>
Since all alike my songs and praises be<br/>
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.<br/>
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,<br/>
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;<br/>
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,<br/>
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.<br/>
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,<br/>
'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;<br/>
And in this change is my invention spent,<br/>
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which three till now never kept seat in one.<br/>
