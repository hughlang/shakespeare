<blockquote>O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,<br/>
Which have no correspondence with true sight!<br/>
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,<br/>
That censures falsely what they see aright?<br/>
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,<br/>
What means the world to say it is not so?<br/>
If it be not, then love doth well denote<br/>
Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'<br/>
How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,<br/>
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?<br/>
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;<br/>
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.<br/>
