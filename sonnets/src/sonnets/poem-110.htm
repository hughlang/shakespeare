<blockquote>Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there<br/>
And made myself a motley to the view,<br/>
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,<br/>
Made old offences of affections new;<br/>
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth<br/>
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,<br/>
These blenches gave my heart another youth,<br/>
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.<br/>
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:<br/>
Mine appetite I never more will grind<br/>
On newer proof, to try an older friend,<br/>
A god in love, to whom I am confined.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.<br/>
