<blockquote>Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,<br/>
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;<br/>
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart<br/>
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.<br/>
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold<br/>
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:<br/>
To say they err I dare not be so bold,<br/>
Although I swear it to myself alone.<br/>
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,<br/>
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,<br/>
One on another's neck, do witness bear<br/>
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.<br/>
