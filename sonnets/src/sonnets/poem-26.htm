<blockquote>Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage<br/>
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,<br/>
To thee I send this written embassage,<br/>
To witness duty, not to show my wit:<br/>
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine<br/>
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,<br/>
But that I hope some good conceit of thine<br/>
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;<br/>
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving<br/>
Points on me graciously with fair aspect<br/>
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,<br/>
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.<br/>
