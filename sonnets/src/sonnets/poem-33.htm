<blockquote>Full many a glorious morning have I seen<br/>
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,<br/>
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,<br/>
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;<br/>
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride<br/>
With ugly rack on his celestial face,<br/>
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,<br/>
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:<br/>
Even so my sun one early morn did shine<br/>
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;<br/>
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;<br/>
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.<br/>
