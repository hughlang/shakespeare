<blockquote>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br/>
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:<br/>
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<br/>
My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br/>
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br/>
And for that riches where is my deserving?<br/>
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br/>
And so my patent back again is swerving.<br/>
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,<br/>
Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;<br/>
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br/>
Comes home again, on better judgment making.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.<br/>
