<blockquote>Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye<br/>
That thou consumest thyself in single life?<br/>
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.<br/>
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;<br/>
The world will be thy widow and still weep<br/>
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,<br/>
When every private widow well may keep<br/>
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.<br/>
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend<br/>
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;<br/>
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,<br/>
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No love toward others in that bosom sits<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That on himself such murderous shame commits.<br/>
