<blockquote>I grant thou wert not married to my Muse<br/>
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook<br/>
The dedicated words which writers use<br/>
Of their fair subject, blessing every book<br/>
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,<br/>
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,<br/>
And therefore art enforced to seek anew<br/>
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days<br/>
And do so, love; yet when they have devised<br/>
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,<br/>
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized<br/>
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And their gross painting might be better used<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.<br/>
