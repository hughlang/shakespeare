<blockquote>Why is my verse so barren of new pride,<br/>
So far from variation or quick change?<br/>
Why with the time do I not glance aside<br/>
To new-found methods and to compounds strange?<br/>
Why write I still all one, ever the same,<br/>
And keep invention in a noted weed,<br/>
That every word doth almost tell my name,<br/>
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?<br/>
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,<br/>
And you and love are still my argument;<br/>
So all my best is dressing old words new,<br/>
Spending again what is already spent:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For as the sun is daily new and old,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So is my love still telling what is told.<br/>
