<blockquote>Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view<br/>
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;<br/>
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,<br/>
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.<br/>
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;<br/>
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own<br/>
In other accents do this praise confound<br/>
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.<br/>
They look into the beauty of thy mind,<br/>
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;<br/>
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,<br/>
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.<br/>
