<blockquote>Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:<br/>
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,<br/>
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep<br/>
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;<br/>
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love<br/>
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,<br/>
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove<br/>
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.<br/>
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,<br/>
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;<br/>
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,<br/>
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But found no cure: the bath for my help lies<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.<br/>
