<blockquote>If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,<br/>
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'<br/>
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;<br/>
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.<br/>
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,<br/>
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.<br/>
In things of great receipt with ease we prove<br/>
Among a number one is reckon'd none:<br/>
Then in the number let me pass untold,<br/>
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;<br/>
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold<br/>
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make but my name thy love, and love that still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'<br/>
