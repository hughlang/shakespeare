<blockquote>Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest<br/>
Now is the time that face should form another;<br/>
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,<br/>
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.<br/>
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb<br/>
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?<br/>
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb<br/>
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?<br/>
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee<br/>
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:<br/>
So thou through windows of thine age shall see<br/>
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if thou live, remember'd not to be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Die single, and thine image dies with thee.<br/>
</blockquote>
