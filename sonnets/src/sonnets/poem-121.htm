<blockquote>'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,<br/>
When not to be receives reproach of being,<br/>
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd<br/>
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:<br/>
For why should others false adulterate eyes<br/>
Give salutation to my sportive blood?<br/>
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,<br/>
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?<br/>
No, I am that I am, and they that level<br/>
At my abuses reckon up their own:<br/>
I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;<br/>
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless this general evil they maintain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All men are bad, and in their badness reign.<br/>
