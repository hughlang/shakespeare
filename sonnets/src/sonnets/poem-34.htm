<blockquote>Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,<br/>
And make me travel forth without my cloak,<br/>
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,<br/>
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?<br/>
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,<br/>
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,<br/>
For no man well of such a salve can speak<br/>
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:<br/>
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;<br/>
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:<br/>
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief<br/>
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.<br/>
