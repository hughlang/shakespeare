<blockquote>Love is too young to know what conscience is;<br/>
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?<br/>
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,<br/>
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:<br/>
For, thou betraying me, I do betray<br/>
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;<br/>
My soul doth tell my body that he may<br/>
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;<br/>
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee<br/>
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,<br/>
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,<br/>
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;No want of conscience hold it that I call<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.<br/>
