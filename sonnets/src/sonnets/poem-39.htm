<blockquote>O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,<br/>
When thou art all the better part of me?<br/>
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?<br/>
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?<br/>
Even for this let us divided live,<br/>
And our dear love lose name of single one,<br/>
That by this separation I may give<br/>
That due to thee which thou deservest alone.<br/>
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,<br/>
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave<br/>
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,<br/>
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that thou teachest how to make one twain,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By praising him here who doth hence remain!<br/>
