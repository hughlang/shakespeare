<blockquote>Let those who are in favour with their stars<br/>
Of public honour and proud titles boast,<br/>
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,<br/>
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.<br/>
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread<br/>
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,<br/>
And in themselves their pride lies buried,<br/>
For at a frown they in their glory die.<br/>
The painful warrior famoused for fight,<br/>
After a thousand victories once foil'd,<br/>
Is from the book of honour razed quite,<br/>
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then happy I, that love and am beloved<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where I may not remove nor be removed.<br/>
