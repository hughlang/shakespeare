<blockquote>Two loves I have of comfort and despair,<br/>
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:<br/>
The better angel is a man right fair,<br/>
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.<br/>
To win me soon to hell, my female evil<br/>
Tempteth my better angel from my side,<br/>
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,<br/>
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.<br/>
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend<br/>
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;<br/>
But being both from me, both to each friend,<br/>
I guess one angel in another's hell:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Till my bad angel fire my good one out.<br/>
