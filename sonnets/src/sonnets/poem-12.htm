<blockquote>When I do count the clock that tells the time,<br/>
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;<br/>
When I behold the violet past prime,<br/>
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;<br/>
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves<br/>
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,<br/>
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves<br/>
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,<br/>
Then of thy beauty do I question make,<br/>
That thou among the wastes of time must go,<br/>
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake<br/>
And die as fast as they see others grow;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.<br/>
