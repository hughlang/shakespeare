<blockquote>Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;<br/>
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?<br/>
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;<br/>
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.<br/>
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,<br/>
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;<br/>
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest<br/>
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.<br/>
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,<br/>
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;<br/>
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief<br/>
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.<br/>
