<blockquote>How can I then return in happy plight,<br/>
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?<br/>
When day's oppression is not eased by night,<br/>
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?<br/>
And each, though enemies to either's reign,<br/>
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;<br/>
The one by toil, the other to complain<br/>
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.<br/>
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright<br/>
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:<br/>
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,<br/>
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.<br/>
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And night doth nightly make grief's strength<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;	seem stronger.<br/>
