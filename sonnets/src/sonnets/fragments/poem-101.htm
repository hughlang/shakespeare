<blockquote>O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends<br/>
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?<br/>
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;<br/>
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.<br/>
Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say<br/>
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;<br/>
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;<br/>
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'<br/>
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?<br/>
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee<br/>
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,<br/>
And to be praised of ages yet to be.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To make him seem long hence as he shows now.<br/>
