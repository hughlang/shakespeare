<blockquote>That you were once unkind befriends me now,<br/>
And for that sorrow which I then did feel<br/>
Needs must I under my transgression bow,<br/>
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.<br/>
For if you were by my unkindness shaken<br/>
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,<br/>
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken<br/>
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.<br/>
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd<br/>
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,<br/>
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd<br/>
The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But that your trespass now becomes a fee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.<br/>
