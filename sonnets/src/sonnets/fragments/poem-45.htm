<blockquote>The other two, slight air and purging fire,<br/>
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;<br/>
The first my thought, the other my desire,<br/>
These present-absent with swift motion slide.<br/>
For when these quicker elements are gone<br/>
In tender embassy of love to thee,<br/>
My life, being made of four, with two alone<br/>
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;<br/>
Until life's composition be recured<br/>
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,<br/>
Who even but now come back again, assured<br/>
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I send them back again and straight grow sad.<br/>
