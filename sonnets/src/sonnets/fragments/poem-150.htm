<blockquote>O, from what power hast thou this powerful might<br/>
With insufficiency my heart to sway?<br/>
To make me give the lie to my true sight,<br/>
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?<br/>
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,<br/>
That in the very refuse of thy deeds<br/>
There is such strength and warrantize of skill<br/>
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?<br/>
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more<br/>
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?<br/>
O, though I love what others do abhor,<br/>
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If thy unworthiness raised love in me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;More worthy I to be beloved of thee.<br/>
