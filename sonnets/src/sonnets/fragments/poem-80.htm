<blockquote>O, how I faint when I of you do write,<br/>
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,<br/>
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,<br/>
To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!<br/>
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,<br/>
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,<br/>
My saucy bark inferior far to his<br/>
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.<br/>
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,<br/>
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;<br/>
Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,<br/>
He of tall building and of goodly pride:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then if he thrive and I be cast away,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst was this; my love was my decay.<br/>
