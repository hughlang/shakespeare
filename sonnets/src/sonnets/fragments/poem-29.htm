<blockquote>When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,<br/>
I all alone beweep my outcast state<br/>
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries<br/>
And look upon myself and curse my fate,<br/>
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,<br/>
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,<br/>
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,<br/>
With what I most enjoy contented least;<br/>
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,<br/>
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,<br/>
Like to the lark at break of day arising<br/>
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That then I scorn to change my state with kings.<br/>
