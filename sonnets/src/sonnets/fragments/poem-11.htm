<blockquote>As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest<br/>
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;<br/>
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest<br/>
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.<br/>
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:<br/>
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:<br/>
If all were minded so, the times should cease<br/>
And threescore year would make the world away.<br/>
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,<br/>
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:<br/>
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;<br/>
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.<br/>
