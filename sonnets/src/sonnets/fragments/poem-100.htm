<blockquote>Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long<br/>
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?<br/>
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,<br/>
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?<br/>
Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem<br/>
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;<br/>
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem<br/>
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.<br/>
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,<br/>
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;<br/>
If any, be a satire to decay,<br/>
And make Time's spoils despised every where.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.<br/>
