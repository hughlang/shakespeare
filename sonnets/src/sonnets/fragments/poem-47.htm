<blockquote>Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,<br/>
And each doth good turns now unto the other:<br/>
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,<br/>
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,<br/>
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast<br/>
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;<br/>
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest<br/>
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:<br/>
So, either by thy picture or my love,<br/>
Thyself away art resent still with me;<br/>
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,<br/>
And I am still with them and they with thee;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.<br/>
