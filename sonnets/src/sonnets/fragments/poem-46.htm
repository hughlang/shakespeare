<blockquote>Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war<br/>
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;<br/>
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,<br/>
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.<br/>
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--<br/>
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--<br/>
But the defendant doth that plea deny<br/>
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.<br/>
To 'cide this title is impanneled<br/>
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,<br/>
And by their verdict is determined<br/>
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.<br/>
