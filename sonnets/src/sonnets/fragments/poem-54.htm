<blockquote>O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem<br/>
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!<br/>
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem<br/>
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.<br/>
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye<br/>
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,<br/>
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly<br/>
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:<br/>
But, for their virtue only is their show,<br/>
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,<br/>
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;<br/>
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.<br/>
