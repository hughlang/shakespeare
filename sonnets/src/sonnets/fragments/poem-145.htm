<blockquote>Those lips that Love's own hand did make<br/>
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'<br/>
To me that languish'd for her sake;<br/>
But when she saw my woeful state,<br/>
Straight in her heart did mercy come,<br/>
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet<br/>
Was used in giving gentle doom,<br/>
And taught it thus anew to greet:<br/>
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,<br/>
That follow'd it as gentle day<br/>
Doth follow night, who like a fiend<br/>
From heaven to hell is flown away;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I hate' from hate away she threw,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And saved my life, saying 'not you.'<br/>
