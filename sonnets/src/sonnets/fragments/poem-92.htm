<blockquote>But do thy worst to steal thyself away,<br/>
For term of life thou art assured mine,<br/>
And life no longer than thy love will stay,<br/>
For it depends upon that love of thine.<br/>
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,<br/>
When in the least of them my life hath end.<br/>
I see a better state to me belongs<br/>
Than that which on thy humour doth depend;<br/>
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,<br/>
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.<br/>
O, what a happy title do I find,<br/>
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.<br/>
