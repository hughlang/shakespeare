<blockquote>Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain<br/>
Full character'd with lasting memory,<br/>
Which shall above that idle rank remain<br/>
Beyond all date, even to eternity;<br/>
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart<br/>
Have faculty by nature to subsist;<br/>
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part<br/>
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.<br/>
That poor retention could not so much hold,<br/>
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;<br/>
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,<br/>
To trust those tables that receive thee more:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To keep an adjunct to remember thee<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Were to import forgetfulness in me.<br/>
