<blockquote>O, lest the world should task you to recite<br/>
What merit lived in me, that you should love<br/>
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,<br/>
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;<br/>
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,<br/>
To do more for me than mine own desert,<br/>
And hang more praise upon deceased I<br/>
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:<br/>
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,<br/>
That you for love speak well of me untrue,<br/>
My name be buried where my body is,<br/>
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And so should you, to love things nothing worth.<br/>
