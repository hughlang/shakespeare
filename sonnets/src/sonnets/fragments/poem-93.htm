<blockquote>So shall I live, supposing thou art true,<br/>
Like a deceived husband; so love's face<br/>
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;<br/>
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:<br/>
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,<br/>
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.<br/>
In many's looks the false heart's history<br/>
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,<br/>
But heaven in thy creation did decree<br/>
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;<br/>
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,<br/>
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!<br/>
