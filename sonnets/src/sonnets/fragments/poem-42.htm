<blockquote>That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,<br/>
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;<br/>
That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,<br/>
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.<br/>
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:<br/>
Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;<br/>
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,<br/>
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.<br/>
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,<br/>
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;<br/>
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,<br/>
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.<br/>
