<blockquote>How can my Muse want subject to invent,<br/>
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse<br/>
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent<br/>
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?<br/>
O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me<br/>
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;<br/>
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,<br/>
When thou thyself dost give invention light?<br/>
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth<br/>
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;<br/>
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth<br/>
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If my slight Muse do please these curious days,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.<br/>
