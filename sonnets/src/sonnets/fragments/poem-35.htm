<blockquote>No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:<br/>
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;<br/>
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,<br/>
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.<br/>
All men make faults, and even I in this,<br/>
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,<br/>
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,<br/>
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;<br/>
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--<br/>
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--<br/>
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:<br/>
Such civil war is in my love and hate<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I an accessary needs must be<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.<br/>
