<blockquote>Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,<br/>
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,<br/>
Before the bastard signs of fair were born,<br/>
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;<br/>
Before the golden tresses of the dead,<br/>
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,<br/>
To live a second life on second head;<br/>
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:<br/>
In him those holy antique hours are seen,<br/>
Without all ornament, itself and true,<br/>
Making no summer of another's green,<br/>
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And him as for a map doth Nature store,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To show false Art what beauty was of yore.<br/>
