<blockquote>But be contented: when that fell arrest<br/>
Without all bail shall carry me away,<br/>
My life hath in this line some interest,<br/>
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.<br/>
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review<br/>
The very part was consecrate to thee:<br/>
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;<br/>
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:<br/>
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,<br/>
The prey of worms, my body being dead,<br/>
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,<br/>
Too base of thee to be remembered.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The worth of that is that which it contains,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And that is this, and this with thee remains.<br/>
