<blockquote>But wherefore do not you a mightier way<br/>
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?<br/>
And fortify yourself in your decay<br/>
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?<br/>
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,<br/>
And many maiden gardens yet unset<br/>
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,<br/>
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:<br/>
So should the lines of life that life repair,<br/>
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,<br/>
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,<br/>
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To give away yourself keeps yourself still,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.<br/>
