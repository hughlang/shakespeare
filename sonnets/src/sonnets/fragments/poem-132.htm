<blockquote>Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,<br/>
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,<br/>
Have put on black and loving mourners be,<br/>
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.<br/>
And truly not the morning sun of heaven<br/>
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,<br/>
Nor that full star that ushers in the even<br/>
Doth half that glory to the sober west,<br/>
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:<br/>
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart<br/>
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,<br/>
And suit thy pity like in every part.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Then will I swear beauty herself is black<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And all they foul that thy complexion lack.<br/>
