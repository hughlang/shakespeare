<blockquote>My glass shall not persuade me I am old,<br/>
So long as youth and thou are of one date;<br/>
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,<br/>
Then look I death my days should expiate.<br/>
For all that beauty that doth cover thee<br/>
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,<br/>
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:<br/>
How can I then be elder than thou art?<br/>
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary<br/>
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;<br/>
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary<br/>
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.<br/>
