<blockquote>For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,<br/>
Who for thyself art so unprovident.<br/>
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,<br/>
But that thou none lovest is most evident;<br/>
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate<br/>
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.<br/>
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate<br/>
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.<br/>
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!<br/>
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?<br/>
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,<br/>
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Make thee another self, for love of me,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That beauty still may live in thine or thee.<br/>
