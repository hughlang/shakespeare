<blockquote>Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,<br/>
With my extern the outward honouring,<br/>
Or laid great bases for eternity,<br/>
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?<br/>
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour<br/>
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,<br/>
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,<br/>
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?<br/>
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,<br/>
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,<br/>
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,<br/>
But mutual render, only me for thee.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.<br/>
