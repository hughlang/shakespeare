<blockquote>Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press<br/>
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;<br/>
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express<br/>
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.<br/>
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,<br/>
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;<br/>
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,<br/>
No news but health from their physicians know;<br/>
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,<br/>
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:<br/>
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,<br/>
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I may not be so, nor thou belied,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.<br/>
