<blockquote>When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,<br/>
For all the day they view things unrespected;<br/>
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,<br/>
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.<br/>
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,<br/>
How would thy shadow's form form happy show<br/>
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,<br/>
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!<br/>
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made<br/>
By looking on thee in the living day,<br/>
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade<br/>
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All days are nights to see till I see thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.<br/>
