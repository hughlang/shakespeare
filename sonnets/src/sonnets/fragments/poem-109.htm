<blockquote>O, never say that I was false of heart,<br/>
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.<br/>
As easy might I from myself depart<br/>
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:<br/>
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,<br/>
Like him that travels I return again,<br/>
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,<br/>
So that myself bring water for my stain.<br/>
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd<br/>
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,<br/>
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,<br/>
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For nothing this wide universe I call,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.<br/>
