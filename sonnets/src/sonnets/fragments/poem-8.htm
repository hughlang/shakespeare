<blockquote>Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?<br/>
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.<br/>
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,<br/>
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?<br/>
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,<br/>
By unions married, do offend thine ear,<br/>
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds<br/>
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.<br/>
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,<br/>
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,<br/>
Resembling sire and child and happy mother<br/>
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'<br/>
