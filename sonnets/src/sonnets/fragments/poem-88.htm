<blockquote>When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,<br/>
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,<br/>
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,<br/>
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.<br/>
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,<br/>
Upon thy part I can set down a story<br/>
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,<br/>
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:<br/>
And I by this will be a gainer too;<br/>
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,<br/>
The injuries that to myself I do,<br/>
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Such is my love, to thee I so belong,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.<br/>
