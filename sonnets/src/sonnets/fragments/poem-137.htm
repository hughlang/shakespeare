<blockquote>Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,<br/>
That they behold, and see not what they see?<br/>
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,<br/>
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.<br/>
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks<br/>
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,<br/>
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,<br/>
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?<br/>
Why should my heart think that a several plot<br/>
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?<br/>
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,<br/>
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.<br/>
