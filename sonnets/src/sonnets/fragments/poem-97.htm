<blockquote>How like a winter hath my absence been<br/>
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!<br/>
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!<br/>
What old December's bareness every where!<br/>
And yet this time removed was summer's time,<br/>
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,<br/>
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,<br/>
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:<br/>
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me<br/>
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;<br/>
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,<br/>
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.<br/>
