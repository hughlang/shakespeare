<blockquote>So am I as the rich, whose blessed key<br/>
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,<br/>
The which he will not every hour survey,<br/>
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.<br/>
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,<br/>
Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,<br/>
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,<br/>
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.<br/>
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,<br/>
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,<br/>
To make some special instant special blest,<br/>
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.<br/>
</blockquote>
