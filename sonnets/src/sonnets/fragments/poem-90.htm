<blockquote>Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;<br/>
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,<br/>
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,<br/>
And do not drop in for an after-loss:<br/>
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,<br/>
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;<br/>
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,<br/>
To linger out a purposed overthrow.<br/>
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,<br/>
When other petty griefs have done their spite<br/>
But in the onset come; so shall I taste<br/>
At first the very worst of fortune's might,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.<br/>
