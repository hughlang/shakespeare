<blockquote>Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan<br/>
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!<br/>
Is't not enough to torture me alone,<br/>
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?<br/>
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,<br/>
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:<br/>
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;<br/>
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.<br/>
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,<br/>
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;<br/>
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;<br/>
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.<br/>
