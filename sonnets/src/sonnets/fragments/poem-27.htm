<blockquote>Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,<br/>
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;<br/>
But then begins a journey in my head,<br/>
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:<br/>
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,<br/>
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,<br/>
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,<br/>
Looking on darkness which the blind do see<br/>
Save that my soul's imaginary sight<br/>
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,<br/>
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,<br/>
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For thee and for myself no quiet find.<br/>
