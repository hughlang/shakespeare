<blockquote>Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all<br/>
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,<br/>
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,<br/>
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;<br/>
That I have frequent been with unknown minds<br/>
And given to time your own dear-purchased right<br/>
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds<br/>
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.<br/>
Book both my wilfulness and errors down<br/>
And on just proof surmise accumulate;<br/>
Bring me within the level of your frown,<br/>
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since my appeal says I did strive to prove<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The constancy and virtue of your love.<br/>
