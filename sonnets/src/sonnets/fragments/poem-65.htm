<blockquote>Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,<br/>
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,<br/>
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,<br/>
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?<br/>
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out<br/>
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,<br/>
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,<br/>
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?<br/>
O fearful meditation! where, alack,<br/>
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?<br/>
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?<br/>
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;O, none, unless this miracle have might,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That in black ink my love may still shine bright.<br/>
