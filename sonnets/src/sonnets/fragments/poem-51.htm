<blockquote>Thus can my love excuse the slow offence<br/>
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:<br/>
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?<br/>
Till I return, of posting is no need.<br/>
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,<br/>
When swift extremity can seem but slow?<br/>
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;<br/>
In winged speed no motion shall I know:<br/>
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;<br/>
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,<br/>
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;<br/>
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.<br/>
