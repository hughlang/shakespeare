<blockquote>Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;<br/>
And yet methinks I have astronomy,<br/>
But not to tell of good or evil luck,<br/>
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;<br/>
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,<br/>
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,<br/>
Or say with princes if it shall go well,<br/>
By oft predict that I in heaven find:<br/>
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,<br/>
And, constant stars, in them I read such art<br/>
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,<br/>
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Or else of thee this I prognosticate:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.<br/>
