<blockquote>Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,<br/>
So do our minutes hasten to their end;<br/>
Each changing place with that which goes before,<br/>
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.<br/>
Nativity, once in the main of light,<br/>
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,<br/>
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,<br/>
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.<br/>
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth<br/>
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,<br/>
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,<br/>
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.<br/>
