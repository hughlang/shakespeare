<blockquote>No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:<br/>
Thy pyramids built up with newer might<br/>
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;<br/>
They are but dressings of a former sight.<br/>
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire<br/>
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,<br/>
And rather make them born to our desire<br/>
Than think that we before have heard them told.<br/>
Thy registers and thee I both defy,<br/>
Not wondering at the present nor the past,<br/>
For thy records and what we see doth lie,<br/>
Made more or less by thy continual haste.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This I do vow and this shall ever be;<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.<br/>
