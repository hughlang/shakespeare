<blockquote>What's in the brain that ink may character<br/>
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?<br/>
What's new to speak, what new to register,<br/>
That may express my love or thy dear merit?<br/>
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,<br/>
I must, each day say o'er the very same,<br/>
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,<br/>
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.<br/>
So that eternal love in love's fresh case<br/>
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,<br/>
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,<br/>
But makes antiquity for aye his page,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding the first conceit of love there bred<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where time and outward form would show it dead.<br/>
