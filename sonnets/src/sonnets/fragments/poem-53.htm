<blockquote>What is your substance, whereof are you made,<br/>
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?<br/>
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,<br/>
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.<br/>
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit<br/>
Is poorly imitated after you;<br/>
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,<br/>
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:<br/>
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;<br/>
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,<br/>
The other as your bounty doth appear;<br/>
And you in every blessed shape we know.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In all external grace you have some part,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But you like none, none you, for constant heart.<br/>
