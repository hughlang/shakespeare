<blockquote>If thou survive my well-contented day,<br/>
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,<br/>
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey<br/>
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,<br/>
Compare them with the bettering of the time,<br/>
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,<br/>
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,<br/>
Exceeded by the height of happier men.<br/>
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:<br/>
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,<br/>
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,<br/>
To march in ranks of better equipage:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But since he died and poets better prove,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'<br/>
