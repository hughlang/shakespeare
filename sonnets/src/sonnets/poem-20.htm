<blockquote>A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted<br/>
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;<br/>
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted<br/>
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;<br/>
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,<br/>
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;<br/>
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,<br/>
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.<br/>
And for a woman wert thou first created;<br/>
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,<br/>
And by addition me of thee defeated,<br/>
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.<br/>
